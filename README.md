# my settings of *Sublime Text 4*

actually usually I use JetBrains IDE's but for some quick file opens or even for [lamarking](https://github.com/danisvaliev001/lamark), I use Sublime Text.

## how to use:
1. install next packages via Package Control:
  - Brackets Color Scheme
  - WordCount

1. copy file content and paste it to:  
Sublime Text ==> Preferences ==> Settings
